# Hey there, I‚Äôm Fadwa! üëã 

I‚Äôm a **Full-Stack Developer** who started coding back in 2019, during a time when the world was locked down, but my curiosity was unlocked. üíª‚ú®

From the first line of code in **HTML** to mastering the magic of **MERN stack**, my journey has been a blend of curiosity, problem-solving, and a bit of caffeine. ‚òï I believe that code is more than just syntax‚Äîit‚Äôs an art that I shape with **love** and creativity.

üåø **I Build With Purpose:**  
Whether it's a website that solves a problem or an app designed to make life easier, every project I work on comes from a place of passion. I don‚Äôt just build; I craft solutions, designing them end-to-end with heart. üí°‚ù§Ô∏è

üé® **Design Enthusiast:**  
Coding isn't enough for me; I love making things **look** as good as they **work**. That‚Äôs why I design my projects from scratch‚Äîno templates, just vision and creativity. **Tailwind CSS** and **SASS** are my trusty tools when it comes to turning ideas into sleek designs.

### üõ† **Tech Arsenal:**

üåç **Mission:**
